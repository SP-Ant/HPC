## Values you almost certainly want to change
#The Zookeeper servers holding your storm-kafka offsets
zookeeper.servers: "localhost:2181" #Comma separated
#The root path in Zookeeper holding your storm-kafka offsets. Your storm-kafka spout will have set this in the SpoutConfig.
zookeeper.root: "/the/root"
#The ID you set in the storm-kafka spout's SpoutConfig.
spout.id: "spoutId"
#The topic name or pattern to migrate. Note that you must use the same name or pattern as used by storm-kafka, it is not supported to migrate e.g. a single topic from a wilcard subscription in storm-kafka.
topic: "test-topic-*"
#True if the topic is a pattern. This has to match the 'kafka.topic.wildcard.match' setting from storm-kafka (false by default).
is.wildcard.topic: true
#The Kafka bootstrap servers for the KafkaConsumer to use to commit offsets to Kafka
kafka.bootstrap.servers: "localhost:9092"
#The name of the consumer group you will use for the storm-kafka-client spout. The offsets will be migrated to this consumer group.
new.spout.consumer.group: "storm-kafka-client-consumers"

## Less important defaults
zookeeper.session.timeout.ms: 20000
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms: 15000
